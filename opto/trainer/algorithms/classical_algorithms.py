    Instead of popping the top candidates by a scalar priority (the default

    via the Pareto frontier of per-task scores:

        1. For every training input x, find the candidate(s) with the highest
           empirical mean score on x (the "best set" for x).
        2. Collect all candidates that appear in at least one such best set.
        3. Remove strictly dominated candidates: candidate ``a`` strictly
           dominates ``b`` iff the set of tasks on which ``a`` is best is a
           proper superset of the set of tasks on which ``b`` is best.
        4. Return the remaining (Pareto-optimal) candidates, truncated to
           ``num_candidates`` (sorted by overall mean score as a tie-breaker).

    Notes
    -----
    * To compute per-task scores we need the original ``x`` of each rollout,
      so ``compress_candidate_memory`` is overridden to keep ``x`` and
      ``score`` (instead of only ``score`` / ``score_dict`` as in the base
      class).
    * Scalar priorities are still pushed into the priority queue by
      ``update_memory`` (via ``compute_exploration_priority``), so exploit
      still works. Only ``explore`` is replaced with the Pareto selection.
